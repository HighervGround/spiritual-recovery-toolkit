The key to making anything more trauma-informed is to modify language or
concepts so that they fit better with your life experiences and
understanding. In our experience, many trauma survivors struggle to
benefit from the twelve steps when they are introduced in a manner that
is rigid and inflexible. We give specific examples many times throughout
this workbook on how you can modify language. You have complete
permission to modify language, especially around spiritual concepts or
words that the authors of the twelve steps originally wrote to be very
gendered. We encourage such modifications, so do not feel that you are
working any less of a twelve-step program in needing to make them.

Let me say upfront that the twelve steps have transformed my life.

Though I hadn't known it, I had long been seeking rules for living and
so when I walked into one of my first twelve-step meetings and saw a
list of the twelve steps on the wall, I thought, "Well, nothing could be
worse than the steps I've been following, so I may as well give these a
try."

I had no idea what any of the words in the twelve steps really meant,
and the fact that some of them included the word *God* definitely
freaked me out, but I was willing.

Turns out that willingness was all it took.

Roughly a decade and a half into sobriety, as I continued to work the
twelve steps, I realized it was time to face the trauma I'd long since
avoided. I had actually known I was destined for trauma therapy since
I'd first heard of its existence but the idea of paying money to cry my
eyes out didn't appeal. I waited, in fact, until I was going through a
breakup that already left me crying my eyes out to finally give it a
try. I figured if I was going to be crying all the time, I might as well
have a quiet place to do it, and possibly get this trauma thing worked
out at the same time.

Luckily, I know some of the world's greatest EMDR experts and so I
reached out to Steve Dansiger. He referred me to a therapist who, over
multiple sessions, guided me through EMDR. It was as foreign to me as
the twelve steps had been when I first spied them on the wall, but I was
desperate to feel better, which meant I was willing. Again.

Processing my trauma has been as profound and transformative as the
twelve steps. It allowed me to break through thought patterns I'd
assumed were too emotionally carved into my brain to ever shift, and I
truly feel like I began to see myself for the first time.

Once I discovered the significance of trauma work, I asked Jamie---the
other great EMDR expert I knew---why she and Steve had never created a
twelve-step guide for trauma. They were as familiar with the twelve
steps as they were with trauma so if anyone was going to do it,
shouldn't it be them?

Luckily for all of us, this became their next project, and they've done
it exquisitely. Their deep understanding of not just the importance of
their mission but also the sacredness of it imbues this workbook with
the kind of depth and weight that's required. By combining their shared
expertise---which includes the twelve steps, meditation, and even
expressive arts work---they've created something magical that no one
else on earth could.

[]{#f05.xhtml_Page_xiv .pagebreak title="xiv"}Going through this book
isn't the same thing as attending a twelve-step meeting, working with a
sponsor, or going to see a trauma therapist, but it's as close as you're
going to get. It will bring you closer to seeing what others around you
surely already do: you're glorious. And the book you're holding can help
you to feel it.

:::

I describe myself as both the biggest fan and the biggest critic of
twelve-step recovery. Thankfully my recovery teaches me that two things
can be true at the same time!

My first sponsor Janet Leff (1941--2017) taught me about twelve-step
recovery in 2001 when I worked as a language assistant and humanitarian
aid worker in postwar Bosnia and Herzegovina. My family is of mixed
Slavic ancestry, primarily Croatian, and I felt a pull to the land
affected by the brutal war that ravaged the countries of the former
Yugoslavia from 1991--1995. Having just finished my undergraduate degree
and feeling rather aimless in life due to my own struggles with
untreated mental illness and addiction, something inside of me suggested
that I would find answers by spending time in my literal homeland.
Janet, an American social worker, relocated to Bosnia and Herzegovina in
her retirement to help with the emergence of some fledging treatment
programs and other initiatives. She correctly identified that addiction
was an issue for me and used the philosophies of twelve-step recovery to
begin validating my addiction as something that was not my fault while
also giving me the tools of the steps to help me bring about meaningful
lifestyle change. Janet was also the first person to give me the
language of trauma to frame so many of my struggles with mental illness.
Up until that point I believed that trauma was something that only
veterans or people who survived war experienced. And interestingly,
there I was working with so many young survivors of a recent, literal
war and I began to see common threads in our respective struggles. Janet
famously said to me, "Maybe the warzone you survived was your house."

I tell the complete version of this story in my book *Trauma and the 12
Steps: An Inclusive Guide to Enhancing Recovery,* which is arguably the
book I am best known for in my career as a therapist, writer, and trauma
educator. Originally published in 2012 and then released by North
Atlantic Books in a revised and expanded form in 2020, my work in this
area seeks to show how the twelve steps originally developed in the
1930s can still be useful for people struggling with addictions,
compulsions, and related issues. The work also acknowledges that the
steps can use some language modifications. Moreover, cultures
surrounding twelve-step recovery are usually in need of a serious update
to account for the realities of unhealed trauma and its impact on the
human experience. These cultures include, but are not limited to,
twelve-step meetings in the community and treatment centers or other
programs that operate with a serious commitment to uphold twelve-step
and disease model paradigms of addiction.

[]{#f06.xhtml_Page_xvi .pagebreak title="xvi"}I've grown so frustrated
with the disregard for trauma that I see in both meetings in the
community and professional treatment settings, I sometimes surprise
myself that I've not just walked away from it all and dismissed the
twelve steps as outdated. Indeed, many of my contemporaries in the
helping professions have long disregarded twelve-step recovery as
archaic and even dangerous. Yes, I call out the dangerous elements in
*Trauma and the 12 Steps* (e.g., abusive sponsorship dynamics,
problematic slogans, abrasive rigidity to working a program, and taking
advantage of new members to any given twelve-step program---especially
sexually). Yet for me and others like me (including my coauthor on this
workbook project, Dr. Stephen Dansiger), there is still healing power in
the steps themselves. A few language updates may be required to make
them more trauma-informed and user-friendly, and such modifications are
what my advocacy seeks to promote.

There is a concept in religious trauma recovery that is growing in
recognition: Deconstruction and Reconstruction. The journey I've been on
with trauma-informing the twelve steps for over a decade now can be
described as such. I've picked it all apart, especially when I realized
just how harmful certain aspects of twelve-step recovery can be when
placed in the hands of counselors, sponsors, and members of various
fellowships who haven't yet come to terms with the impact of trauma on
their own lives. By engaging in this necessary criticism, I've managed
to salvage the components that still work for me and seemingly for
countless others. And embracing these gifts also emboldens me to
highlight where the problems exist and call for new, more inclusive
recovery paradigms. I am delighted that so many people have found
benefit in the original *Trauma and the 12 Steps* and its related
projects over the years. I hope that this expanded workbook will add to
the growing collection of resources as we seek to address the interplay
of trauma and addiction.

A friend in long-term recovery recently asked me what my recovery is
looking like these days in terms of what I do to *work a program* or
keep myself healthy and well after twenty years. As I shared with him, I
do not go to twelve-step meetings very regularly anymore even though I
am absolutely clear that abstinence and refraining from alcohol and
controlled substances continue to serve me best. I remain in close
contact with my long-term sponsor Dharl (whom I also write about more
fully in *Trauma and the 12 Steps*) and a close-knit group of other
folks in recovery who feel like my family of choice. There are many
queer folks and several other "Rebel Twelve-Steppers" in this group of
loving people surrounding me. Presently I find more nourishment from
yoga and meditation groups that meet with an aim of recovery more than I
benefit from traditional meetings, and I also remain actively engaged
with my personal trauma therapist. Even though meetings are not such a
critical part of my life anymore, the steps and ideas of twelve-step
recovery are. They accompany me in every other piece of work that I do
in my life, both personally and professionally. I realize that the steps
and the path of total abstinence may not be a fit for everyone, yet my
hope is that they can continue to be shared with people who are
suffering in as compassionate and trauma-responsive a way as possible.

:::

Over the last couple of years (2020--2022), like many people I have met
along the way, I have had some of my old traumas resurface.

These traumas can manifest in many ways. For some people I talked to,
they manifested as a reengagement with substances, or an outbreak of
behaviors that had been dormant. For others, it was problems with
sadness, grief, depression, or anxiety. In my case, at over thirty years
of recovery, it resulted in my seeking yet another trip through the
twelve steps, in addition to anything and everything else I do to stay
healthy. In my both/and approach to my recovery, all hands were on deck
and all new and well-worn ideas were welcome.

Back in 2012 when I came upon Jamie's work on *Trauma and the 12 Steps,*
I knew a number of things. One was that this was one of my people.
Another was that the twelve steps need not be static or stagnant, but
can be alive and dynamic. And the most important thing was that if we
honored the role of trauma and trauma healing in recovery, we could
continue to change the world.

My meeting Jamie was just one of many steps on my journey that has been
blessed with great ideas and people throughout. I feel like my major
guides in this process were all trauma-informed before anyone used that
verbiage. I have always been treated with great compassion and loving
kindness by sponsors, I have found friends on the path who did not judge
each other for the bumpiness of our individual recovery voyages, and I
have found twelve-step groups that intuitively worked in ways that
honored trauma. I am well aware that this has not been the case for
everyone. It is in the spirit of increasing access to a lifelong
process, a community endeavor, and a sustainable healing path that we
offer this new edition of our step workbook to you.

My years of substance addiction were a roller coaster. I discovered
alcohol and cannabis as a twelve-year-old, which in hindsight I see was
spurred on by trauma, both intergenerational and event-based. I became
more and more involved with those two substances until the age of
sixteen, when I added much more to the mix as I left for a much too
early entry into college. All of this was side by side with a burgeoning
career as a drummer in punk rock and art rock bands, creating an
escalation of my commitment to heavy drinking and drug use.

My scheduled four-year college stint ended after two years in the
university hospital, my music career stopped and started and sputtered
and crawled, and at the age of twenty-six, my friend Maggie took me to
my first AA meeting. Her implicit trauma-informed approach was a
steadfast commitment to "attraction, not promotion" that allowed me to
inspect the whole thing on my own but with her kind support and
oversight always available. I then met friends new and old in the
meetings ("I was wondering why Keith wasn't at the bar anymore and where
he went . . .") and started doing what was suggested. I did service for
groups, I spent a lot of time bopping around the Lower East Side of New
York City to meetings, went to coffee shops in between, and started to
feel the sunshine on my face. I went to an AA retreat at a Zen
monastery, learned how to sit meditation, and began practicing
mindfulness regularly (now at over thirty years and counting). I quit my
music career, just as one band got signed to a major label, so I could
stay focused on recovery.

[]{#f06.xhtml_Page_xviii .pagebreak title="xviii"}When it was time to
explore working again, I went to the Employment Program for Recovering
Alcoholics (which still exists) and found myself suited to be a high
school English teacher. My trauma education through direct experience
continued when, after my first year of teaching, there was racial unrest
in the school neighborhood. I taught about what we witnessed and
experienced on the fly, was trained to teach about it in a more
structured manner, and went on to facilitate conversations on systemic
oppression and issues of diversity for almost fifteen years.

By the time I became a therapist in the early 2000s, I was steeped in
the language of trauma and mindfulness. So, when I was introduced to
EMDR therapy, it made a lot of sense very quickly and became my primary
therapeutic modality. Before I met Jamie and discovered her book, I knew
that the twelve steps were not antithetical to trauma recovery, and that
trauma recovery was available through the twelve steps when the
practitioners and sponsors had the right support and framework.

What is it like now? I actually go to a good number of meetings in more
than one fellowship. I am doing a lot of online meetings for a number of
reasons, not the least of which is the international flavor, and by
default, more diverse populations. The twelve steps are an integral part
of my multifaceted recovery plan. I seek help from a trauma therapist. I
lead and participate in Buddhist meditation groups regularly, and also
have found my way back to other forms of spirituality, including the
religion of my birth, Judaism. I write and coauthor books on clinician
self-care, mindfulness, anger management, EMDR therapy, and addiction.

All this is to say that I have an integrated and integrative life. My
hope for you is that this book might help you on a twelve-step journey,
whether you are brand new to it or multiple decades in, that will allow
you the deep healing and increased presence that delivers a life worth
living, fully alive, living authentically. A trauma-responsive
twelve-step journey can be a powerful driver or one aspect of such a
life. May you be free from fear, healthy, and happy. And, may you be at
ease.

> Enhancing Recovery*

In the various twelve-step programs, members emphasize the importance of
working the steps *in order to cope, to manage emotions, and ultimately
to recover.* What does that really mean . . . to *work* a step? How does
one actually *work* a step? Like many answers people receive in
twelve-step programs, it largely depends on whom you ask.

Some people are very by the book . . . literally. If you are a member of
Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), a sponsor may guide you to work the steps
directly as they are instructed in the "Big Book" of AA. First published
in 1939 and now in its fourth edition (with a fifth coming soon), the
Big Book is very specific about how you can work some steps and very
vague about others. If you are a member of Narcotics Anonymous, it's
likely that you've been instructed to use a step workbook published by
that fellowship. With hundreds of fellowships growing from the original
seeds planted by AA, lots of books now exist and there are a great many
ideas on the market and in the public forum on how to work the steps.

Many twelve-step sponsors guide their sponsees through the steps in the
exact same way that their sponsors showed them. Passing on your own
experience, strength, and hope as a sponsor can be a beautiful thing.
Yet, if it's relayed with the rigidity of "if this way worked for me, it
will work for you," problems can ensue. As explained in *Trauma and the
12 Steps: An Inclusive Guide to Enhancing Recovery* (the book on which
this workbook is based), this inflexible mentality is what can make
working the twelve steps a retraumatizing trap for people struggling in
recovery. Jamie writes, "The best way to look at flexibility in a
trauma-sensitive context is that it represents the ability to meet
newcomers where they are *at* in the recovery or change process.
Flexibility []{#f07.xhtml_Page_2 .pagebreak title="2"}is the opposite of
rigidity, and rigidity is a trait on display at so many recovery
meetings and in many treatment
centers."^[\*](#f07.xhtml_f07-footnote-001){#f07.xhtml_f07-footnoteref-001}^

We are happy to present you with this trauma-responsive step work guide
as a companion piece to *Trauma and the 12 Steps* or to be used on its
own. Since the publication of the original *Trauma and the Twelve Steps:
A Complete Guide to Enhancing Recovery* in 2012, Jamie has received
multiple requests for a step guide that takes trauma into consideration.
As she worked on the new edition of *Trauma and the 12 Steps: An
Inclusive Guide to Enhancing Recovery,* she responded to the challenge
and brought her longtime collaborator Dr. Stephen (Steve) Dansiger on
board to create this new resource.

As Steve reflects, "I can't deal with charts, graphs, and columns; I
just had to turn them onto their side and make a narrative." He explains
that people in programs have different philosophies. In his early
recovery, he had two sponsors and experienced directly the peril of
mixed messages. His first sponsor would tell him to waltz Steps One,
Two, and Three over and over again the first year, and then wanted him
to exit this waltz pattern and dive into the mosh pit of Step Four. His
other sponsor from those first years suggested he dive into all the
steps in order as soon as possible in the first year. When all was said
and done, Steve found a way to combine those two approaches and make
them his own. However, many other people might despair on hearing
conflicting philosophies from different folks around the rooms of
recovery and may even leave the program in frustration as a result. Our
feeling is that there is no one right way to work any of the steps, as
long as you are working them.

In this workbook, we guide you through the twelve steps, breaking down
each one in a trauma-focused way. A meditation or coping skill of focus
is included for each respective step. Traditional writing and expressive
arts exercises are given for each step to help people on various stages
of their recovery journey work the steps, whether it's their first time
or a repeat journey through. Working the steps the first time can feel
scary or unfamiliar while also necessary, and we take this knowledge
into consideration. We also recognize that for most of us committed to a
twelve-step path, the steps are not meant to be worked through only
once. Some steps you may practice on a day-to-day basis, while others
may require a more thorough revisit at different times in your recovery.
Many folks in long-term recovery make this a yearly practice, or
whenever life challenges seem to necessitate reworking the steps.

This workbook is the first of its kind to have trauma as the focus
alongside recovery principles in working the twelve steps. Our working
definition of *trauma* is any unhealed wound---physical, emotional,
sexual, spiritual, or otherwise---that gets in the way of you living the
fullest life possible. As explored more fully in *Trauma and the 12
Steps* and in other resources we make available to you online, unhealed
trauma is more than just diagnosable post-traumatic stress disorder.
Innovations in the fields of medicine, psychology, counseling, social
work, and addiction counseling continue to reveal that unhealed trauma
is a major factor in the development of []{#f07.xhtml_Page_3 .pagebreak
title="3"}addiction---as well as the potential for relapse. This
understanding may challenge what you've originally been taught as a
person in twelve-step recovery---that addiction is a primary disease.
Period.

While some people see twelve-step programming and working the twelve
steps as an antiquated practice, the position of Jamie and others who
support her in the *Trauma and the 12 Steps* work is that the steps can
still be incredibly useful. However, the flexibility inherent in the
language must be harnessed if unhealed trauma is still present. Working
the steps can be a valuable part of both initial and ongoing recovery as
long as the role of unhealed trauma is acknowledged and honored. We've
heard countless horror stories of people who were scared or otherwise
shamed away from working the steps because their sponsors,
professionals, or other guides wouldn't make modifications or meet them
where they *were at* in the recovery process. We hope to change some of
the rigid and often stifling mentality around step work with the
approach we present in this workbook.

A hallmark of trauma-informed care is that trauma-responsive
modifications may be necessary. For instance, while step-related tasks
may need to be accepted with commitment, they do not have to be
completed in perfect lockstep with traditional approaches or forms. This
rigid thinking is what blocks many folks from even approaching the steps
to begin with. As an early recovery friend of Jamie's wisely declared,
"Your first time through, work the steps as best as you can."

We believe that applies for any venture you take through the steps at
whatever place in life you find yourself. We invite you to make a
commitment to do this trauma-informed work, appreciating its importance
in empowering you with a sense of flexible structure you may need for
successful recovery. You can bring in outside skills like meditation or
non--twelve-step--specific coping strategies to help you meet the
challenges that may come up in your body, mind, and spirit as you
approach step work. Unhealed trauma is stored in the place in the brain
that makes trauma-influenced reactions likely to play out in your body.
Symptoms like tightening stomach and chest, sweaty palms, and a sense of
checking out or shutting down can be common when you are faced with a
task such as working the steps. The internal experiences that come up in
working the steps may remind you of traumatic experiences or show you
areas you still need to address and heal.

This is why we include a meditation and/or coping skill strategy of
focus with each step. Being able to ground yourself and retreat if you
become overwhelmed, especially if you are working through these steps on
your own, is very important. If you ever become too overwhelmed in
working any one step, know that you can take a break at any time. The
opening exercise we offer in this workbook before you even work a single
step is to take an inventory of your grounding, retreat, and safeguard
strategies. We hope that using these will empower you to take the
necessary breaks you need to feel stronger and more grounded so you can
return to the work ahead.

If you have the ability to use this workbook alongside a sponsor or
study group, that is ideal. Being able to share your step work with
someone can be a big part of the healing process, as long as that person
reasonably understands your need to take a more trauma-focused approach
[]{#f07.xhtml_Page_4 .pagebreak title="4"}as advocated for in this
workbook. You can also bring in other literature when working the steps.
Each step in this workbook contains an excerpt from *Trauma and the 12
Steps* that you can use to further explore the step. As an alternative,
you may choose to read the step you are working on in the book *Twelve
Steps and Twelve
Traditions*^[\*](#f07.xhtml_f07-footnote-002){#f07.xhtml_f07-footnoteref-002}^
every day you are in progress with the step, meditate upon it, and then
write a reflection. Another resource we now have available is *Trauma
and the 12 Steps: Daily Meditations and
Reflections,*^[†](#f07.xhtml_f07-footnote-003){#f07.xhtml_f07-footnoteref-003}^
where readings for each day of every month correspond with each step.
You may find these meditations supportive in your step work process. And
always remember that there is no shame in seeking outside professional
help. Some of the most successful step work we've seen people do and
have had the privilege to witness ourselves has been in concert with
professional trauma-focused therapy or support services.

    God as we understood
    Him.^[†](#f07.xhtml_f07-footnote-005){#f07.xhtml_f07-footnoteref-005}^

    nature of our wrongs.
6.  Were entirely ready to have God remove all these defects of
    character.
7.  Humbly asked Him to remove our shortcomings.
8.  Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make
    amends to them all.
9.  Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to
    do so would injure them or others.
10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong promptly
    admitted it.
11. Sought through prayer and meditation to improve our conscious
    contact with God as we understood Him, praying only for knowledge of
    His will for us and the power to carry that out.
12. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we
    tried to carry this message to

[]{#c01.xhtml_Page_10 .pagebreak title="10"}Safety may feel like a
foreign idea to you at this point in your recovery. Remember that there
may never be such a thing as feeling perfectly safe. Think in terms of
*safe enough.* At this point in your recovery, are there any people with
whom you feel *safe enough* who can offer support as you do this step
work? Perhaps people don't feel especially safe to you right now---are
there animals, places, or experiences that are fundamentally healthy, do
not involve drugs, alcohol, or acting out, and feel safe enough?
Consider whether any of these people, beings, places, or experiences can
work for you as a refuge or a break when step work is getting
overwhelming. We've deliberately made this an open space without lines
so that if artwork feels more organic to you than writing, you may
express yourself in that way.

## **[]{#c02.xhtml_Page_12 .pagebreak title="12"}Basic Grounding Meditation**

Grounding is a relative term. Much like perfect safety is a big ask for
anyone in recovery, a perfect sense of grounding is often elusive, and
may well be unrealistic. Demanding it of ourselves can be a motivation
killer or a setup for failure. In this meditation, we seek to become
*grounded enough* for this moment, for this day. The more we notice our
level of grounding on a day-to-day basis, the more we will become
attuned to what works best for us to ground ourselves more consistently.
In the spirit of modification, you may elect to use a word other than
grounding, such as *anchoring* or *settling* as your inspiration and
guide for the meditation. Try this meditation and notice how it feels
prior to starting, during the meditation, and when it ends.

- First, take a posture that feels sustainable for the amount of time
  you have scheduled for this meditation.
- Notice contact points. If you are seated in a chair, for instance,
  notice the sensation of your back against the chair. Notice the
  feeling in your seat, the backs of your legs, your feet on the floor.
- Notice other contact points, like your arms against your body, and
  your hands wherever they rest.
- Notice if one or more of these points of contact feels grounded, or
  more grounded than the others. If what you notice is, "I don't feel
  particularly grounded," then see if you can notice that lack of
  grounding with as little judgment as possible. If, in fact, you do
  feel some grounding somewhere, go ahead and lean into that grounding.
  Let yourself have that ground.
- For the remainder of this meditation, allow yourself to continue to
  lean into that ground. If anything changes during the meditation, let
  yourself notice it and move with it if necessary. Reground yourself at
  any time.
- Here, we are looking not for quantity, but rather for consistency in
  practice. Five minutes a day is just fine, and if five minutes is too
  long, one minute is just fine. The key is to practice daily or as
  consistently as possible. That's how we set up the habit of noticing
  where we are with our sense of grounding each day, and develop a
  better idea of what we need to do to ground ourselves proactively.
  Again, five minutes a day is even better than thirty minutes on
  Saturday with nothing at all the rest of the week.

otherwise resistant people struggle with the term *powerless,* the step
does not say that we are powerless people. The step simply says that we
are powerless when it comes to alcohol, drugs, etc. This means that if
we put alcohol or drugs into our body, they will win every time.
Behaviors can have a similar impact. By admitting defeat, we are carving
the pathway to reclaim our power on the road ahead. The distinction is
an important one in working with newcomers or new clients who may feel

## **[]{#c03.xhtml_Page_20 .pagebreak title="20"}Meditation: Befriending Your Breath**

Our breath is our life force moving and dancing through us. Learning to
take a deep, attentive breath during moments of stress or activation is
one of the best stress-reducing practices that any human being can
embrace. This practice becomes especially necessary for people on a
recovery path and survivors of trauma. Our tendency can be to hold our
breath, something that we likely developed by spending too much time in
a state of hypervigilance.

To test out this contention, we invite you to crunch your shoulders up
toward your ears for just a few moments. When we are in hypervigilance,
our shoulders can assume this position of high alert. Now notice what's
happening to your breath when your shoulders are up against your ears
like this. It's very likely that your breath is shallow and you feel cut
off from it. Now go ahead and release the shoulders and immediately
notice what happens to your breath. Say hello to it if you like!

Engaging in specialty deep breathing exercises that you may learn in a
yoga class or via online videos can be helpful yet challenging to those
of us affected by trauma, especially if we feel cut off from our breath
and our bodies. (We encourage you to check out our wide array of breath
strategies at www.traumamadesimple.com.) In this meditation you are
encouraged to start in a very slow and basic way. The intention here is
to get to know your breath (hopefully you've already said hello to it)
and begin paying attention to it.

- You may close your eyes, leave them open, or experiment with the two.
  Whichever position will help you feel safe enough yet stay engaged
  with the practice is optimal.
- Engage in the shoulder crunch and release at least three more times.
  Every time you release, try to pay a little more attention to how your
  breath responds to the release.
- Move into at least thirty seconds of just noticing the breath as it
  naturally rises and falls in your body. You do not have to do anything
  special with technique, simply notice. Does your breath feel warm,
  cool, or neutral moving through your body? Is there a sensation or
  even a sound that goes along with it? If you'd like to spend longer
  than thirty seconds in this practice, go for it.
- You may notice that your mind starts to wander as you begin and
  continue with the meditation. This is normal! Instead of judging
  yourself for not being able to pay attention, see if you can invite
  the attention back to the breath when you notice it wandering. Even if
  you have to do this every other second, truly, it's okay.

<!-- -->

- []{#c03.xhtml_Page_21 .pagebreak title="21"}Some people find it
  helpful to hold a grounding or anchoring object in their hand while
  they try this exercise (e.g., a rock, a recovery coin), and others
  find it helpful to focus on one part of the body and think about the
  breath moving in and out through that part of the body.
- Another favorite anchoring device of ours, drawing directly on wisdom
  from Buddha, is to repeat this saying as you breathe: "As I breathe
  in, I know I am breathing in. As I breathe out, I know I am breathing
  out." You can simply modify this to "In" (as you breathe in) and "Out"
  (as you breathe out).
- Try this exercise as many times as you need to get the flow of it and
  consider repeating it for consistency every day. If you find yourself
  stuck while working a step, put the pen aside and come back to the
  breath. Holding your breath does not make things easier! Your breath
  is your friend and wants to support you in this process of healing.

[]{#c03.xhtml_Page_23 .pagebreak title="23"}A great struggle with this
step is the element of spirituality it introduces, even for those
newcomers to twelve-step programming who do not identify unresolved
trauma as a major issue. However, if a trauma survivor relied on the
fight of self-sufficiency to get through the trauma and cope over the
years, it may be very difficult for them to accept (at first) that
something outside of themselves is going to help them heal from the
addiction. Even if the individual believes in God and is open to
spirituality, reliance on something other than self may be problematic
for a trauma survivor. The word *sanity* also poses an interesting
challenge. If we need to be "restored to sanity," then we must be
insane! If a newcomer, especially a trauma survivor, reads this step
without having the root meanings of *insanity* and *sanity* properly
explained or at least explored, there is a greater risk for
insult-induced triggering that can
happen.^[\*](#c03.xhtml_c03-footnote-001){#c03.xhtml_c03-footnoteref-001}^

Validating all of these as possible areas of struggle, where are you
able to see, identify, or even admit areas in your life that are
*unhealthy* today? Make it easier on yourself and use this word
*(unhealthy)* for now! Where are you at with the concept of a *Higher
Power* today (knowing that you have complete permission from us to use
whatever may feel appropriate as a *Higher Power*---or a popular
alternative, an *Inner Power*)? To really work this step you may have to
do some venting, and that is okay.

## **Meditation: Higher or Inner Power Visualization**

On the twelve-step path you have complete freedom to choose or to allow
your own conceptualization of a *Higher Power* to emerge. This includes
not even needing to use the term *Higher Power.* For instance, many
yogis prefer to use the term *Inner Power,* which feels more aligned
with the belief that God, spirit, or anything Divine lives within you.
God does not have to be some scary being up on a cloud looking over all
of us. Yet, if you draw healthy and helpful comfort from that image of a
God who hangs out on a cloud, you are completely empowered to use that
image. If you identify as someone who is atheist or agnostic, what you
use as a power greater than yourself (or outside of yourself) may look
and feel completely different. In this meditation, you are given the
freedom to explore.

- Begin by coming into at least thirty seconds of mindful breathing with
  your eyes closed or opened. Do whatever you may need to in order to
  feel supported and grounded before engaging in breath.
- Set an intention to work with the essence of Step Three for this
  meditation and ask yourself, through the breath, what needs to be
  revealed. Begin by asking which terminology may work best for you:
  *God, Higher Power, Inner Power, spirit, the universe, humankind, the
  Greater Good,* or something completely different. Notice what is
  revealed without forcing it and learn to listen to that vital spark
  that says, "This is it!" You will likely know it if you feel it. If
  nothing particularly resonates for you the first time, that's okay
  too. You can always try this as many times as you need to.

<!-- -->

- []{#c04.xhtml_Page_29 .pagebreak title="29"}After the term that works
  for you reveals itself, spend at least thirty seconds (longer if you
  wish) reflecting on it. With every breath, connect to it. Begin
  noticing how the body feels.
- Notice if anything emerges visually. The less you force it, the more
  likely your connection will happen. There are so many combinations of
  what may be revealed as viable for you. For some people the visual
  that shows up looks like a person or group of people, for others it's
  more like a light or even a sensation. Once again, if nothing special
  seems to happen, keep trying the exercise a few more times without
  forcing.
- Quick reminder: You cannot do anything wrong here! This may mean that
  you need to intentionally send away any old pictures or
  conceptualizations of what you were taught *God* or *Higher Power*
  needed to look like. You can literally shake it off or flick your
  hands to the ground in release.
- Whenever you see or sense into what is revealed, spend as much time as
  you need noticing it without judgment. Notice what happens in your
  breath. Notice what happens to your body. Notice if the experience is
  pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral.
- Pay attention and see if whatever you are noticing has a message for
  you, whether that comes in the forms of words or bodily sensations.
- Know that you can stop this meditation whenever you need to; you are
  in control the whole time. When it concludes, you may consider
  journaling or reaching out to a member of your support network if you
  need to further process the experience. If what emerged for you feels
  like it will work as you move forward with Step Three and the rest of
  the steps, we encourage you to go with it.

[]{#c04.xhtml_Page_31 .pagebreak title="31"}Although some twelve-step
groups and sponsors may misinterpret the step, in its truest form the
step leaves it up to individuals to decide how they will conceptualize
their *Higher Power*---an idea that allows for flexibility and
modification. . . . For some, having the religious and spiritual
elements downplayed or not even used may be part of the solution. For
others, truly feeling free to develop a new relationship with
spirituality or even religion may be the key to freedom. Remember that
the program does allow people to find their own conceptualization of
*God, Higher Power,* or as one of my teachers offers as an alternative,
*Inner
Power.*^[\*](#c04.xhtml_c04-footnote-002){#c04.xhtml_c04-footnoteref-002}^

Even though the step references God, you are completely free to define
*God/Higher Power/Inner Power* or any alternative concept as you see
fit. This may fly in the face of how you were raised or feel like it's
egotistical for you to do the defining. Your self-esteem could also feel
so low right now that you're filled with ideas that anything you
conceptualize cannot possibly be good. See if you can set all of this
aside and simply riff on how you need to conceptualize *God/Higher
Power,* etc. in a way that works for you and your recovery today.

## **[]{#c05.xhtml_Page_36 .pagebreak title="36"}Meditation: Loving Kindness**

In the world of mindfulness, Loving Kindness meditation has become one
of the most popular ways to engage in heart practice. As we work Step
Four, it is critical that we counterbalance the pain and distress of
looking at our history of trauma and adverse life events with the
resources and resilience it takes to keep going. Loving Kindness
meditation allows us to keep a focus on (and to cultivate) loving
kindness toward ourselves and toward others. This quality of loving
kindness in and of itself is known to be a dedicated result of working
the steps and other spiritual paths. However, years of experience have
shown that in order to work the steps, it helps to actively cultivate
these heart qualities, even if we don't fully feel them at first. Here
is how you might practice loving kindness as you enter and progress
through Step Four and later steps.

- First, take a posture that feels sustainable for the amount of time
  you have scheduled for this meditation.
- Notice contact points. If you are seated in a chair for instance,
  notice the sensation of your back against the chair. Notice the
  feeling in your seat, the backs of your legs, your feet on the floor.
- Notice other contact points, like your arms against your body, and
  your hands wherever they rest.
- Notice if one or more of these points of contact feels grounded or
  more grounded than the others. If what you notice is, "I don't feel
  particularly grounded," then see if you can notice that lack of
  grounding with as little judgment as possible. If, in fact, you do
  feel some grounding somewhere, go ahead and lean into that grounding.
  Let yourself have that grounding.
- Begin to silently repeat the loving kindness phrases included here, or
  feel free to use others that you find or create yourself. Repeat these
  toward yourself first: *May I be free from fear; May I be healthy (or
  healed); May I be happy; May I be at ease.* You can start with three
  rounds of these phrases for each person or being you are sending them
  to.
- Now begin emanating these phrases outward as far as you please. You
  might start with someone it is easy to send loving kindness to, like a
  loved one or a pet. *May you be free from fear; May you be healthy;
  May you be happy; May you be at ease.* You might also send it to
  someone who has been a great help to you. You can then move outward
  incrementally, sending it to everyone on your block, everyone in your
  city, your country, this world, even as far as all beings in all known
  and unknown universes. For the last round, consider sending one more
  set of these phrases back toward yourself.

<!-- -->

- []{#c05.xhtml_Page_37 .pagebreak title="37"}Know that in traditional
  Loving Kindness meditation, we often will send loving kindness toward
  a person or being we call "the difficult person." In this version of
  the meditation, that is not required, as we are trying to build our
  positive neural networks, rather than challenge ourselves in this way
  from the beginning. However, as you progress through working with this
  meditation and Step Four, you can consider adding the difficult person
  to your meditation. Often the order is something like: ourselves, the
  easy person, the person who has helped you, the neutral person, and
  finally, the difficult person. Then you can proceed with sending it
  further and wider, as before.
- As with other meditations, we are looking here not for quantity, but
  rather for consistency of practice. Five minutes is just fine, and if
  five minutes is too long, one minute is just fine. The key is to
  practice daily if possible. That's how we establish the habit of
  working with loving kindness each day. Again, five minutes a day is
  even better than thirty minutes on Saturday with nothing at all the
  rest of the week.

is worded, particularly the word *moral,* which is a stumbling block for
many of us. What is your present association with the word *moral* and

up the word *moral* and its various meanings in the dictionary---pick
the presentation of it that works best for you and then see if you can
approach this step from there.

[]{#c05.xhtml_Page_39 .pagebreak title="39"}Steps Four and Five in a
twelve-step program are no doubt the gauntlet, for these steps ask us to
make an inventory of our rights and wrongs (preferably in writing), and
then share these findings with another human being. . . . Many
individuals struggle with the word *moral,* especially if they grew up
in religious environments; or they automatically associate the word
*immoral* with the idea that they are defective. People need proper
guidance to do this step in a sensitive
manner.^[\*](#c05.xhtml_c05-footnote-001){#c05.xhtml_c05-footnoteref-001}^

Step Four should never be a punishment, rather it is an opportunity to
take stock---a natural extension of what may have led us to approach
this program or work a Step One in the first place. If I can reword and
thus rethink this step as *taking stock* of the things I see about
myself, both healthy/unhealthy and everything in between, might that
ease some of the anxiety around the concept of *moral inventory?*

way and notice whatever comes up. Let it naturally lead you into the
inventory, "taking stock," or whatever phrase you need to use to get
this step done. Remember the wisdom of Jamie's friend---do your best to
work the step as you can right now in your journey. It doesn't have to
be perfect. If you've worked this step before, what is your focus in
this pass through the steps? What is the intention you are setting for
how you would like your life to be different by working this step?

## **[]{#c06.xhtml_Page_44 .pagebreak title="44"}Advanced Grounding Meditation**

People can never have too many methods at their disposal to practice
grounding, especially when working Steps Four and Five, which are known
to be overwhelming for people. Feeling overwhelmed can be a normal part
of life in recovery, so working with finding one's ground in response to
stressors that come up in this step can be excellent training for the
journey ahead. Consider trying out some of these strategies for
grounding, building on what we gave you in the meditation for Step One.
Let the person who is hearing your Fifth Step know that you may need to
take a "grounding break" every now and again as you share what you need
to share. You can even invite them to remind you of your grounding
skills if they notice that you are becoming too overwhelmed or even
dissociated as you share. Remember that other words like anchoring and
settling may be a better alternative to you than grounding. You may even
describe this process to your sponsor or the person hearing your Fifth
Step as needing to *catch your breath* or *take a break.*

- Take a look around the room or space where you currently find yourself
  and notice what you see. Observe and describe it, without getting too
  caught up in analyzing what you see. Perhaps you notice an object that
  especially resonates with you. Maybe it's a figurine, a clock, a
  picture, a statue, or a certain color pattern on a set of curtains.
- Designate that object or thing standing out to you as an *anchor
  object.* Whenever you feel shaky or are not sure where you are at, you
  can look at that anchor object and have assurance that you are here,
  now, and present.
- Continue this process of scanning with your other senses, especially
  if the visual anchor doesn't feel particularly strong. Notice what you
  hear in your space (or the absence of sound), and what you smell when
  you take a breath. Maybe there's a taste in your mouth.
- For the sense of touch or sensation, touch your clothes, press your
  feet into the floor, or make contact with your fingers and whatever
  surface on which you are sitting.
- Notice where you feel your sense of *here, now,* and *being in the
  present* the strongest, and practice returning here several times
  throughout your day, especially in advance of working Step Five.

permissiveness that we've given you to alter the language and
conceptualization around *God/Higher Power* applies here too. Might
there be past experiences with speaking something out loud to someone
else that did not go well for you, and might that be a roadblock to you
working Step Five at this point?

to be heard by *another human being. . . .* Steps Four and Five are
tricky. Often described as the hardest steps to get through, the

unresolved trauma. Challenging, but not impossible---if proper
preparation has taken
place.^[\*](#c06.xhtml_c06-footnote-002){#c06.xhtml_c06-footnoteref-002}^

You are empowered to choose the person who feels as safe and as
affirming as possible, despite the fact that you may have been told that
a pastoral figure or a sponsor must hear your Fifth Step. Trauma
survivors often feel more comfortable sharing their Fifth Step with a
professional, and this option is totally acceptable. Who is standing out
in your life and your circle of support right now as the best possible
candidate to hear what you came up with in Step Four?

## **[]{#c07.xhtml_Page_52 .pagebreak title="52"}Meditation: Mindfulness of Body**

One of our Zen teachers once said to a group of beginning meditators,
"This is not actually a practice of the mind. It is a practice of the
body." Allowing ourselves to become mindful of our body, which includes
the breath, gives us an alternative to focusing in on our eternally
moving mind and its gyrations. It allows for spaciousness in our
thinking and emotions. Thus, the practice allows us to come into a
humble relationship with ourselves, our strengths, and our shortcomings.
It gives us the opportunity to sit with what is happening in the moment
and listen to our innermost selves for what we need to accept and keep,
and what we need to change.

- First, take a posture that feels sustainable for the amount of time
  you have scheduled for this meditation. If you choose to stand, lie
  down, or be in motion, that will work too.
- Notice contact points. If you are seated in a chair for instance,
  notice the sensation of your back against the chair. Notice the
  feeling in your seat, the backs of your legs, your feet on the floor.
- Notice other contact points, like your arms against your body, and
  your hands wherever they rest.
- Notice if one or more of these points of contact feels grounded, more
  grounded than the others. If what you notice is, "I don't feel
  particularly grounded," then see if you can notice that lack of
  grounding with as little judgment as possible. If, in fact, you do
  feel some grounding somewhere, go ahead and lean into that grounding.
  Let yourself have that grounding.
- You may continue to be aware of bodily sensations related to what you
  are noticing in this moment. We also invite you to direct some
  attention to your breath, which is a big part of mindfulness of the
  body. Notice the physical sensations just outside or just inside the
  nostrils, or the rising and the falling of the belly. Take a few
  breaths from this place.
- When your mind inevitably goes into thought, stop for a moment and
  notice you have left your object of meditation, the body and/or the
  breath. Note to yourself, *thinking,* and then return to your
  observation point. Whether you never have to do this again, or you do
  it a thousand times in five minutes, no matter---you are successfully
  working with mindfulness of the body.

<!-- -->

- []{#c07.xhtml_Page_53 .pagebreak title="53"}This simple practice can
  become your primary practice going forward if you like. Settle into
  your posture, notice the body, notice the breath, notice you have gone
  into thought and lost your awareness of body and breath, and return to
  the body and breath.
- As with other meditations, we are looking here not for quantity, but
  rather for a consistency of practice.

[]{#c07.xhtml_Page_54 .pagebreak title="54"}The wording in Step Six is
rife with many potential problems; it is naturally the step where I most
emphasize the need for modification. For instance, in the basic text of
the Workaholics Anonymous fellowship, an allowance is made to replace
*character defect* with *negative coping skill.* These generally develop
as a result of unhealed trauma or wounding. The addictive substance or
behavior of choice simply amplifies the behavioral evidence that the
wound(s) in question
manifests.^[\*](#c07.xhtml_c07-footnote-002){#c07.xhtml_c07-footnoteref-002}^

How can you change the language around in a way that makes working this
step more approachable? Some people prefer to see defects of character
as negative or unhealthy coping skills that developed in response to
unhealed or unaddressed wounding.

## **[]{#c08.xhtml_Page_60 .pagebreak title="60"}Meditation: Mindfulness of Feeling Tone**

Mindfulness of Feeling Tone allows us to take our mindfulness of the
body and expand it out to other elements of our being. The factor that
provides containment and direction for this meditation is a rating
system related to our experience. Think about it. Anything and
everything we can think, feel, or experience, couldn't it all be rated
on a scale of Pleasant, Unpleasant, or Neutral? That is what we do in
this meditation. It helps to further build our distress tolerance, and
it helps to give perspective to all of our experiences without judgment
or shame. And it helps us to work Step Seven by noting our changing
relationship to ourselves and our experiences, opening up the
opportunity for a willingness to accept any help available to us and
move further into humility with a foundation of dignity and power.

- First, take a posture that feels sustainable for the amount of time
  you have scheduled for this meditation. You may choose a nonseated
  posture.
- Notice contact points. If you are seated in a chair for instance,
  notice the sensation of your back against the chair. Notice the
  feeling in your seat, the backs of your legs, your feet on the floor.
- Notice other contact points, like your arms against your body, and
  your hands wherever they rest.
- Notice if one or more of these points of contact feels grounded, more
  grounded than the others. If what you notice is, "I don't feel
  particularly grounded," then see if you can notice that lack of
  grounding with as little judgment as possible. If you do feel some
  grounding somewhere, go ahead and lean into that grounding. Let
  yourself have that grounding.
- As you settle into your posture and breathing, notice whatever comes
  into your consciousness first. Is it a bodily sensation, an emotion,
  or a thought? As soon as you notice what you are noticing, take a
  breath and rate it on the scale of Pleasant, Unpleasant, or Neutral.
  Notice that experience and then return to your original object of
  meditation whether it is the body or the breath.
- As soon as you notice another thought, feeling, or sensation, take
  another moment and give it a rating. Simply continue this process as
  often as it arises for the duration of your meditation.
- When you finish the meditation, notice a general sense of Pleasant,
  Unpleasant, or Neutral. Notice anything that seems the same from
  before the meditation session, and anything that has changed.
- Each day we may build a little more distress tolerance, a little more
  ability to maintain perspective.

this idea that twelve-step recovery places too much emphasis on

## **[]{#c09.xhtml_Page_68 .pagebreak title="68"}Meditation: Mindfulness of Mind**

Mindfulness of Mind takes us to another level of awareness of how our
mind experiences things. Instead of a rating system, we are allowing
ourselves to notice a bit more of what our mind is up to on a
moment-to-moment basis. Noticing our mind as an Eighth Step exercise
allows for a more integrated view of our mind, our body, and our past
experiences in life. It helps us further train our mind to lean toward
nonjudgment. That spirit of nonjudgment will more than likely transfer
quite nicely to our upcoming journey into the world of forgiveness.

- First, take a posture that feels sustainable for the amount of time
  you have scheduled for this meditation. You may choose a nonseated
  posture. Eyes may be open or closed.
- Notice contact points. If you are seated in a chair for instance,
  notice the sensation of your back against the chair. Notice the
  feeling in your seat, the backs of your legs, your feet on the floor.
- Notice other contact points, like your arms against your body, and
  your hands wherever they rest.
- Notice if one or more of these points of contact feels grounded, more
  grounded than the others. If what you notice is, "I don't feel
  particularly grounded," then see if you can notice that lack of
  grounding with as little judgment as possible. If you do feel some
  grounding somewhere, go ahead and lean into that grounding. Let
  yourself have that grounding.
- After taking a number of breaths, notice what you are noticing. Allow
  your mind to identify the sensation or the experience, and then notice
  which of your senses has brought it to your attention. Is it a sound?
  A smell? A taste? Is it something you are seeing, regardless of
  whether your eyes are closed? Is it a bodily sensation, something from
  the world of touch? With this meditation, along with noticing the
  category of sense related to what you are aware of, notice whether you
  are inclined to go toward it or away from it, with as little judgment
  as possible. We are just noticing, not judging. Once you have
  investigated this part of your mind's experience, let go and go back
  to your breathing or body.
- Much like the Mindfulness of Feeling Tone meditation, continue this
  process for the length of the meditation. Unlike the Mindfulness of
  Feeling Tone meditation, allow yourself to take a few breaths in
  between each round of noticing what your mind is landing upon.

<!-- -->

- []{#c09.xhtml_Page_69 .pagebreak title="69"}As with other meditations,
  here we are looking not for quantity, but rather consistency. In these
  later steps, we are allowing ourselves to investigate more complex
  aspects of our experience and our mind. Be gentle with yourself if you
  find yourself taken away by thoughts. Your mind is just doing what it
  is built to do, it is thinking.

Eight is worded and notice where some problems may exist for you. You

[]{#c09.xhtml_Page_71 .pagebreak title="71"}Steps Eight and Nine, often
referred to as the "making things right" steps, usher in their own
unique set of challenges. With proper guidance and a productive working
through of the previous seven steps, these paired amends steps do not
have to be as scary as they seem. . . . Without proper guidance, working
these steps can be a disaster for someone in recovery who has not fully
addressed issues of unresolved trauma, especially if people on the
*amends list* (Step Eight) are some of the same people who inflicted the
trauma.^[\*](#c09.xhtml_c09-footnote-001){#c09.xhtml_c09-footnoteref-001}^

Above all else, this step is about willingness---do you have the
willingness to make things right if it's in the best interest of
yourself and the person involved? To answer this question you and your
sponsor or support system may need to explore what it means for you to
be *willing.* Bear in mind that even willingness may come in degrees.
For instance, you may be willing enough even if you don't feel
completely ready to go there, and that may be okay for now. And the
guidance you receive from a sponsor or professional may be that actually
making the amends itself in Step Nine may not be in your best interest
or in the best interest of others. Yet exploring the willingness
component can still be therapeutic to your process.

If this is your first time working Step Eight, what is prompting you to
take this journey to the next level *now?* If you've worked this step
before, what is your focus in this pass through the steps? What is the
intention you are setting for how you would like your life to be

## **[]{#c10.xhtml_Page_76 .pagebreak title="76"}Meditation: Mindfulness of Wisdom**

Adapted from an early Buddhist teaching called the Four Foundations of
Mindfulness, Mindfulness of Wisdom can mean many things, including
maintaining mindfulness of larger teachings. When applied to the twelve
steps, there is so much we can draw from and meditate upon. While some
of the twelve-step literature suffers from its time and place of origin
and therefore is not trauma-informed, the reason twelve-step recovery
has survived and thrived is because of the greater wisdom at its
foundation and within it. We can utilize traditional twelve-step
teachings for this meditation, or we can reach into the spiritual,
psychological, and humanistic traditions over the millennia for more
mindfulness-focused practice. We have come to the end of a process here
in Steps Four through Nine, and as such, are ready to consider, be
informed by, and enact the teachings as we go through our amends
process.

- First, take a posture that feels sustainable for the amount of time
  you have scheduled for this meditation. You may choose a nonseated
  posture. Eyes may be open or closed.
- Notice contact points. If you are seated in a chair for instance,
  notice the sensation of your back against the chair. Notice the
  feeling in your seat, the backs of your legs, your feet on the floor.
- Notice other contact points, like your arms against your body, and
  your hands wherever they rest.
- Notice if one or more of these points of contact feels grounded, more
  grounded than the others. If what you notice is, "I don't feel
  particularly grounded," then see if you can notice that lack of
  grounding with as little judgment as possible. If you do feel some
  grounding somewhere, go ahead and lean into that grounding. Let
  yourself have that grounding.
- Choose one twelve-step teaching that you are going to investigate
  during this meditation period. You can simply make it a mantra to
  repeat over and again, or you can gently bring it into your
  consciousness and look at it from all sides.
- The teachings can include but are not limited to: *One day at a time,*
  *live and let live,* *easy does it,* or any other slogans; the twelve
  steps as a whole, or one of the individual steps, the power of
  fellowship, the essence of sponsorship, humility, willingness,
  gratitude, or any other of the dozens of teachings that have sprung
  from the twelve steps.

<!-- -->

- []{#c10.xhtml_Page_77 .pagebreak title="77"}You can always utilize
  another spiritual path's teachings as your object of meditation. In
  Buddhist practice for instance, meditating on loving kindness,
  compassion, sympathetic joy, and/or equanimity is a common practice.
  You can use anything that has arisen from your being in this program,
  whether it is spiritual, psychological, humanistic, atheistic---any
  teaching that resonates with you.
- Allow yourself as much as possible to bask in these teachings, to
  allow them to become further integrated into your life. As always,
  even with a more complex meditation such as this, just five minutes a
  day may be your best bet to establish consistent practice.

[]{#c10.xhtml_Page_79 .pagebreak title="79"}If traumatized individuals
have not yet taken sufficient steps to reprocess the trauma (either in
twelve-step recovery or through professional counseling), the likelihood
is very high that they will be emotionally ill-equipped to determine
what constitutes harm to self or others in making amends. The greatest
emotional disasters I have seen with people working Steps Eight and Nine
are when they refuse to heed the guidance of a sponsor and/or counselor.
I've seen many cases of people in recovery who have gone to abusive
parents or an abusive spouse and dumped everything for the sake of
making things right. Yet the other party may not have the emotional
capacity to reason, especially if that other party is still inflicting
trauma on others. Thus, further shaming can result from the process of
doing Steps Eight and Nine, which is not the intention of the
step.^[\*](#c10.xhtml_c10-footnote-001){#c10.xhtml_c10-footnoteref-001}^

Whether or not we go on to make the direct amends, having the
conversations with our sponsor or other guides in the process of
determining how to make them (or whether to make them at all) is vital
to our growth. What have you learned about the art of making living
amends in this process, considering that the best amends we can make
come in the form of changed behavior moving forward?

## **[]{#c11.xhtml_Page_84 .pagebreak title="84"}Meditation: Daily Practice Log**

The concept of inventory in the twelve steps directly translates to the
concept of self-improvement or self-evaluation popular in other healing
modalities, as well as to the observance of self-study in the yoga
traditions. Many different methods can work for engaging in the practice
of self-inventory, and Step Ten gives us an opportunity to explore and
see what will work best for us. The key is to find a self-evaluation
practice where we do not beat ourselves up over every little
"wrongdoing" or slip in interaction or self-care, yet we stay consistent
with regard to looking at ourselves and what works to help us stay as
healthy as possible.

Jamie's first sponsor Janet once advised her to write a list of
everything she was doing (or not doing) on the weeks when she felt the
most solid in her recovery. Janet then advised her to leave this list in
her Big Book or on the refrigerator, so during weeks that were a
struggle she could go to this list and take stock. For your Step Ten
practice, you may consider doing something as simple as that, especially
if you've been living on a recovery path for a while. If you've not yet
considered or tapped into what a good week feels like, you may consider
engaging in this more specific practice of keeping a log.

- Earmark some space in your daily recovery journal or art journal, or
  simply set aside some pieces of paper for this process.
- This practice is generally done best at the end of each day when you
  can look back and reflect on what worked and what didn't work.
- You can keep a list with bullet points like this about the specific
  tasks you engaged in on any given day that seemed to help with your
  recovery. If you went to meetings as part of your day, note which
  meeting you attended, what you got out of it, and whether or not that
  meeting felt like a good fit.
- You can also note on the list what didn't feel especially helpful to
  your recovery on any given day (e.g., talking to a certain negative
  person, turning to a behavior for comfort that made you feel worse
  afterward).
- Some people like to approach this daily inventory with columns. If
  using this method, try to stay away from overtly judgmental language
  like "Good for Recovery" and "Bad for Recovery." Consider titling
  columns "Helpful"/"Unhelpful," "Healthy"/"Unhealthy,"
  "Nourishing"/"Depleting," or any language that feels like the most
  helpful fit for you. To get away from the binary, you can even

Four, the idea of inventory may prove problematic so consider replacing
it with the idea of self-evaluation, or what yogis call self-study. If
you've come this far in working the steps, we hope you realize by now
that you can be kind to yourself, even when taking a look at your
difficult stuff. The Tenth Step affirms that although we are not going
to be perfect going forward, daily evaluation is imperative. Might
framing it this way take some of the edge off about being wrong?

[]{#c11.xhtml_Page_87 .pagebreak title="87"}Admitting wrongdoing (the
challenge of Step Ten) can prove difficult for those easily triggered by
traumatic stimuli. Defensiveness can run high. One of the best places
for an individual in early recovery to practice Step Ten is on the job.
I remember in my early recovery, I found it so hard to admit when I was
wrong at work because I took every bit of feedback, or every legitimate
critique of my performance, as a personal insult. The more I addressed
my trauma issues, the less and less I became triggered upon being
criticized. I was thus better able to work Step Ten on a daily
basis.^[\*](#c11.xhtml_c11-footnote-001){#c11.xhtml_c11-footnoteref-001}^

## **[]{#c12.xhtml_Page_92 .pagebreak title="92"}Meditation: Bodyfulness and Movement**

In this trauma-informed step workbook we've incorporated many
meditations from the tradition of mindfulness---the art and practice of
coming back to the present moment, without judgment. For many of us who
practice yoga, dance, or other somatic healing methods, the concept of
bodyfulness is just as vital. While drawing from the wisdom of
mindfulness, *bodyfulness* (a term coined by Dr. Christine Caldwell)
reminds us that coming home to our bodies is of utmost importance. The
things we often do to cope with the legacy of unhealed trauma can cut us
off from the essential information our bodies provide and what it can
teach us about our experiences and ourselves. For many of us, being told
unkind things about our body further increases this disconnect.

Learning to befriend your body and listen to its signals and wisdom can
be a process in recovery. As you work on cultivating deeper levels of
meditation in the Eleventh Step, we are encouraging you to really bring
your body and its natural inclination to move into this process of
connection. Even if you balked or got a little bit scared reading that
last sentence, take pause and notice where you may have felt the "ping"
in your body that registered scared or hesitant. That is what we mean by
learning to listen to your body's signals. Your body will tell you what
is going on with you well before your rational mind can compute what's
going on.

This meditation utilizes a popular *T'ai Chi* form called *Painting
Light.* Follow these steps to the level of your comfort, knowing that
you are in control of how long you practice this at any one time. The
practice can be done sitting, standing, or lying down. If you are
immobile for any reason, you can rely on the power of your visual
imagination to see and track the experience of light moving up and down
your body and notice wherever any flickers of sensation may show up
(e.g., in the eyes, on your face).

- In whatever position you choose (standing, sitting, or lying down),
  take a few moments to really rest into that position. Breathe. Notice
  the connection of your body to the surface on which you are standing,
  sitting, or lying down.
- On an inhale, draw both arms out in front of you about shoulder
  height. On the next natural inhale, draw the arms overhead as much as
  possible.
- On the next natural exhale, draw the hands and arms down, synchronized
  with the breath. Bring them down at least to the waist although you
  can go as low as the knees.
- On the next natural inhale, draw the hands and arms back up overhead,
  connected with breath.

<!-- -->

- []{#c12.xhtml_Page_93 .pagebreak title="93"}Continue with this natural
  movement for as long as you intend, bringing to mind the phrase
  *Painting Light.* Are there any colors you wish to visualize along
  with your movements?
- As a variation, you can add music and/or let the arms flow freely out
  to the sides or in different directions, coming back to the *Painting
  Light* form as you wrap up.
- Take at least thirty seconds, preferably longer, to stand (or sit) in
  silence and notice what you notice in the stillness after engaging in
  the movement. This noticing is the essence of meditation.

[]{#c12.xhtml_Page_94 .pagebreak title="94"}Take a look at how Step
Eleven is worded and notice where some problems may exist for you. We
certainly hope that some of the guided meditations in this book have
helped you move through any barriers to meditating. However, for many
people beginning their step work, the concept of *meditation* feels
inaccessible. For others, being told specifically how to pray in this
step is a major problem (while for countless others it's a comfort).
Where do you stand on Step Eleven?

out."^[\*](#c12.xhtml_c12-footnote-003){#c12.xhtml_c12-footnoteref-003}^
Many of the struggles trauma survivors face in this step tend to be
spiritual in nature. Some people battle with the spiritual aspects of
recovery for quite some time, so they may still encounter the same
challenges presented by Steps Two and Three with letting go of their
self-sufficiency. Another problem for trauma survivors can show up in
this step: the intricacy of God's will. Many trauma survivors have
trouble with the concept of *God's will* because it may be nearly
impossible to wrap their understanding around the notion that the
traumatic experiences they endured were somehow God's
will.^[†](#c12.xhtml_c12-footnote-004){#c12.xhtml_c12-footnoteref-004}^

## []{#c13.xhtml_Page_100 .pagebreak title="100"}Share Your Practice {#c13.xhtml_h1-179335c13-0001}

If you have made it to this point in the book, you have now learned
eleven different meditation strategies that you can use to prepare for
each step. In the spirit of paying it forward that defines the Twelfth
Step, we encourage you to take any one of the practices covered in this
workbook and share it with someone in your circle---a sponsee, a friend,
a client, or just someone you know in recovery. If your immediate
reaction upon reading that directive is, "I can't teach meditation,"
take a breath into that reaction and then release it. To be clear, we
are asking you to share the practice; share how you have received it in
words that work for you (although you are more than welcome to read from
this workbook as a guide).

Doing good Twelfth Step work is not about being perfect, it is about
sharing---from the heart and from the depths of your experience,
strength, and hope---what has worked for you. Be open to having the
conversation with the person receiving what you share as to how they may
need to modify different practices to work for them. This particular
exercise is simply a training ground for the art of sharing that defines
Step Twelve.

[]{#c13.xhtml_Page_103 .pagebreak title="103"}Yes, a big part of Step
Twelve is to carry the message to others who suffer. This does not mean
that you become solely responsible for another's life or recovery. The
step is not an open invitation for you to forget working on yourself as
a sacrifice to others. The purpose of the Twelfth Step has always been
to keep the person working it sober. . . . I've seen many people in
recovery get caught up in the trap of reaching out to others in service
at the expense of their own recovery. This is a problem we don't talk
about enough in recovery settings and we need to address it more fully.
The culprit is likely (you guessed it) unhealed
trauma.^[\*](#c13.xhtml_c13-footnote-002){#c13.xhtml_c13-footnoteref-002}^

What are you noticing now that you have worked through the steps using
this format?

That question may open up a whole new stream of writing or inventory
that you can journal on or use the expressive arts to explore! That is
the beauty of working a recovery program whether or not the steps are
specifically guiding you. There is always something more to explore.
Living a lifestyle where you are committed to recovery is never about
reaching a finish line. Rather, we can recognize that with each new
season of challenges life may bring our way, we can rise to meet those
challenges from a place of continued health and growth, or from old,
reactionary patterns that kept us stuck for so long.

In our experience, working the steps is not a "one and done" exercise.
You don't work them and then suddenly you get a medal, or a guarantee
that your life in recovery will be marvelous forever. Hopefully by
working the steps in the manner laid out in this workbook, you've been
able to see that how you work a step at one point in your life may be
different from how you are working it at another. And there is always
room to grow and continue the work on yourself. For some people, this
continued work in long-term recovery includes a yearly working through
of the steps. For others, it's learning to listen to the subtle signals
that say, "Something is amiss, I'd better take action," or "It's time to
get back to basics," prompting a reworking of the steps.

We've prepared this workbook as a resource that can be used and adapted
wherever you are in your journey. No matter how many times you work
through it, we hope you discover something new and fresh on each pass
through. Please remember that *Trauma and the 12 Steps: Daily
Meditations and
Reflections*^[\*](#b02.xhtml_b02-footnote-001){#b02.xhtml_b02-footnoteref-001}^
is another resource you can check out that can better help you work the
steps in a day-to-day format. As we teach throughout our work, a small
amount of practice on a consistent, daily basis is much better for us
overall than doing nothing for days or weeks on end and then spending a
big chunk of time on meditation or another recovery endeavor.

We hope you find this wisdom to be a useful inspiration for the road
ahead.
